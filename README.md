# PD:TH Enhanced Singleplayer
A mod for Payday: The Heist that adds player-side and team AI enhancements in singleplayer heists whilst trying to leave enemy-side balance untouched.

IMPORTANT NOTE: While this mod is active you won't be able to play multiplayer at all, along with achievements and steam statistics being completely disabled. This mod will also create a new save file so you can't just farm XP from challenges or heist completions on your main save, leaving it untouched from modded gameplay.
