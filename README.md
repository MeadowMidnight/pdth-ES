# PD:TH Enhanced Singleplayer
A mod for Payday: The Heist that adds player-side and team AI enhancements in singleplayer heists whilst trying to leave enemy-side balance untouched.

IMPORTANT NOTE: While this mod is active you won't be able to play multiplayer at all, along with achievements and steam statistics being completely disabled. This mod will also create a new save file so you can't just farm XP from challenges or heist completions on your main save, leaving it untouched from modded gameplay.

# Features:
  
From the mod settings, you can select up to 3 crew bonuses that the bots can give to you. (They DO NOT stack when the same one is used.)
- Aggressor (10% damage bonus)
- Protector (50% more armor, it is originally only 10% in the vanilla game)
- Sharpshooter (25% less spread, originally 10% in vanilla)
- Big Game Hunters (15% more ammo)
- Speed Reloaders (20% faster reload speed, originally 10% in vanilla)
- Noob Lube (20% more experience)
- Mr Nice Guy (20% more experience)

When both Mr Nice Guy and Noob Lube are used, they give 44% more experience.

These bonuses will always be active, even if the bots are downed, in custody or playing without them.

You can change the crew bonuses to "Not Active" if you don't want them.

You can revert the buffed statistics back to their vanilla ones in mod settings.

Challenges have went through several changes:
- Challenges now give 2x the amount of XP then they normally did in vanilla, making grinding less tedious and easier to level up from a new save.
- Repetitive challenges like weapon kills had their requirements lowered due to them being boring to complete.
- Overdrill is now possible to trigger in Singleplayer.
- Quick Hands is now possible because of the 0.1 second interaction times for defusing C4. (Yes, I know this is a band-aid and janky fix)
- Noob Herder is now possible if all 3 bot crew bonuses are set to Noob Lube and the difficulty is on Overkill or above in the heist.
- Challenges don't give Steam achievements in this mod.
- No Photos is now earned by simply destroying a single camera, but it gives less XP.

Progression Changes:
- Loot pickups such as cash, gold and diamonds had their values adjusted, and they scale depending on the difficulty played.
- End of heist rewards were tweaked.
- You now earn 200 XP per camera destroyed in a heist.
- Slaugherhouse gives +1000 XP per gold secured, it increases up to +2500 on Overkill 145+
- Counterfeit money found in the basement only gives +800, up to +2000 on Overkill 145+
- The same values above apply to the 70 pieces of gold found in the Overdrill vault in First World Bank, as they both share the same data.
- The blue sapphires found in Diamond Heist give +400 XP, up to +1000 on Overkill 145+
- Same thing applies to the diamonds in the vault in the same heist mentioned, and to the money randomly found in First World Bank, Panic Room and Slaughterhouse.
